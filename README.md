This application allows the user to play the age old game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

- [Deployed Client](https://xpertimage.github.io/tic-tac-toe-client/)

## Planning Story

The application planning started with researching the API documentation including both the user and game. With the foundation of the API features and specifications I went on to developing user stories and wireframes. There was much debugging along the way and tweaking of the styling.

### User Stories

- As a user I want to sign in/up
- As a user I want to Create a new game.
- As a user I want to be able to see a history of my games.
- As a user I want to be able to change my password.
- As a user I want to know who won the game.
- As a user I want to be able to sign out.
- As a user I want to be able to choose any empty space on the game board.
- When the game is over I want to be able to start a new game.
- When the game is over I should not be able to change the game board.

### Technologies Used

- jQuery
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript

### Unsolved Problems

- Still need to make the UI more polished.
- Would like to eventually allow a user to play against the computer.
